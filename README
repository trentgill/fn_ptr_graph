// function pointer graph
// basic dsp project for navigating a dynamic dsp graph

// stage one
wrGraph is initialized with no nodes

the graph will be manipulated via the command line
essentially going to write a tiny language
might as well roll a forth in there haha

there should be a generalized form in jk of getting CLI strings into the block

// example lines
add <module type>
    print id
rm <id>
cat <id:output> <id:input>
get <id:param>
    print val of param
set <id:param> <val>
cut <id:output> <id:input>
.S
    print <state>

// .S
special print function that displays the whole graph
each module listed by id & shows type (and params?)
modules grouped by processing order
processing paths are colour coded from source
each node could display CPU percent
    cpu is calculated from assembly output
any calcs optimized out should be noted (grey?)
